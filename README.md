# LibraryManagementSystem

The Library Management System is a Java program that simulates a library's operations. It allows users to add books, search for books by title or author, check out books by providing user details, return checked-out books, and display the library's catalog. The program uses classes like Book and Library to encapsulate the book details and library operations, respectively. It provides a user-friendly interface through a menu-driven console application.
